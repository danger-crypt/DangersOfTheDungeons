# Dangers Of The Dungeons

**Dangers of the Dungeons** (DOTD) is an extremely bare-bones, simple role-playing game that is written using C#.

This is not in any way meant to be a game to blow anything out of the water or baffle anyone. This is actually my first attempt at making any kind of project using any programming language that isn't HTML or CSS. 

It will be a text based game, with no graphics or anything. Just a project to test my skills and see what I can do. 

An enormous thanks goes to [Scott Lilly](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/)! Simply put, I wouldn't have the knowledge to create a project like this. 
A very well constructed guide that allows readers to actually implement C# concepts in a "learn-by-doing" style of programming, which I've found to be an asstoundingly more effecient method of retaining the programming concepts which are being taught, as opposed to you're typical educational/course based learning-resources.
